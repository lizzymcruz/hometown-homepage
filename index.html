							<h2>Mt. Olis Hike</h2>
							<p>
							If you love chasing sunrises or simply want to see the mountains dressed in clouds, Mt. Olis is the place to be. The hike isn’t too tough, and once you reach the top, the view makes every step worth it — think Cordillera mountains stretching endlessly and crisp, cool air that wakes you up better than coffee.

							<h2>Northern Blossom Flower Farm</h2>
							<p>
							This is easily one of Atok’s stars. Imagine rows upon rows of vibrant flowers — celosias, roses, snapdragons — all framed by the rugged beauty of the mountains. It’s the perfect spot for photos, but more than that, it’s a place to just pause, breathe, and enjoy nature’s colors.

							<h2>The Highest Point (Philippine Highway System)</h2>
							<p>
							At 7,400 feet above sea level, this spot along the Halsema Highway gives you a bird’s eye view of Benguet. The pine trees, the winding roads, the endless sky — it’s a reminder of just how high up you are. On a clear day, you can even catch glimpses of nearby peaks.
